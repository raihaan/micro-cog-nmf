This folder contains python scripts which begin extracting data from text files to build nmf input matrices
For each of ct, sa, md, fa, rd, data exists as text files per subject
extract*py read in text files for each metric, concatenate them and write out matrices with dimensions # of vertices X # of subjects
*raw.mat is raw data - read in .txt file, build matrix, write out
*resid.mat is residualized for scanner

Submitted commands:
qbatch --header 'module load cobralab/2019b' --header 'source /home/m/mchakrav/patelmo6/virtual_envs/oxmicro/bin/activate' --env none -w 00:30:00 -c 5 -j 1 joblist_extract


build_nmf*py scripts read in the residualized data (outputs from extract*py) and:
a) perform zscoring for each metric/hemisphere combination
b) concatenate metrics and write out data
c) writes out .mat files for each metric, for left hemisphere, right hemisphere, and whole brain
*build_nmf_input_matrix.py prforms zscore pervertex across subjects while build_nmf_input_zall_matrix.py performs zscoring across BOTH subjects and vertices for each metric matrix

**above was run Mar 21 2020, but then subject list changed so rerun Apr 8**
