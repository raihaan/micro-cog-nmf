in this folder, input matrices for each of 10 splits are constructed for use in stability analysis
for splits 1 to 10, subjects are split into age stratefied groups
splits were constructed on my laptop, {A,B}splits_indices.p contain the subject indices for each split
ie if you load raw data, subjects 0,1,4 go to split A and 2,3,5 go to B for example

build_stability_input_matrices.py - cycles through splits in {A,B}splits_indices.p and builds input matrices for a and b groups, for each of 10 splits
				  - outputs a_{0:10}.mat and b_{0:10}.mat, which are input to nmf later
