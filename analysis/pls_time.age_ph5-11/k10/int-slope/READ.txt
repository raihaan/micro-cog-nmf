in this folder pls is run to assess brain-behav relationships
this analysis does not include age OR edu

#analyzed at CIC:
pls_int_slope_k10.m - reads in nmf weight and cog data .csv files and runs behavioural pls
			      saves results to pls_res_k10.mat

the above script was run from the command line:
> module load matlab/R2016a
> matlab -nodisplay -nosplash -nodesktop -r "run('pls_int_slope_k10.m');exit;"

pls results are saved in pls_res_k10.mat

then .mat outputs saved in file to port to python for plotting

#analyzed on my laptop:
.png figures created with:
for l in {one,two}; do python plot_lv_res.py lv_${l}.mat lv_${l}_int-slope; done

view_lv_stats.ipynb is used to merge demographic, nmf, pls data (demo_nmfk10_pls_int-slope.csv)
                also used to view significant contributing brain and behav variables from lv

demo_nmfk10_pls_int-slope.csv - csv containing demographics merged with nmf weights, merged with pls re>

demo_behavscores_lvcontinuous_tform_lms.R - R script which runs lms of wave12score ~ lv1 + lv2 + age + >
this script outputs a number of .png figures to figures/, mostly lvscore vs wave12score
see script for plot creation

demo_behavscores_lvcontinuous_lms.R - equivalent to demo_behavscores_lvcontinuous_tform_lms.R but
uses untransformed data

paperfigs_figure3_table2.ipynb - used to create bar plots of latent variable results, and print corr and confidence intervals of behaviours in each lv.
				this notebook used for Fig 3 and Table 2 in paper
				lvone_flat.png and lvtwo_flat.png are imported to Fig3
paperfigs_figure4.ipynb - used to create lv score subplots, scatter plots, lv group figure for Figure 4
plot_lv_schematic_overview.ipynb - used to create schematics figs of PLS/LVs in Fig 1
